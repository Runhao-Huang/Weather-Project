# Weather-Project
Using Node.js, express, html, nodemon to link to OpenWeather API. A website that allows people to check the current weather of cities.
***Notice***
This is the first time of me using node.js and now I only know how to hold it on a local server. 

So before you try it out, please do npm i in command line.
npm i

And to see the website, please use localhost:3000 on your website. Then that should be fine!!!
